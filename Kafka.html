        <strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>
        <p>This was during the time as a Senior Integrations specialist. We had to reprovision end to end environment
            solutions for clients and certifications. Some of these activities required that we set up Kafka and
            RabbitMQ feeds to stream triggered events to the clientsâ€™ targets. This process was extremely manual.
        </p>
        <p>We were also migrating all triggered event streaming from RabbitMQ to Kafka which meant we needed to support
            both platforms during our state of transition until all clients were ready to deprecate the RabbitMQ feed.</p>

        <strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
        <p>I started by using the Rabbit MQ API to create all the needed Topics, Queues and exchanges with the relevant
            routing config via POSTMAN. This was then ported to C# and PowerShell. The reason for PowerShell was due to
            modularity that was slotted into another automated solution that the team was comfortable with.</p>
        <p>Following this I needed to achieve the same with Kafka. However, this was deployed and run on RedHat Linux.
            For this I simply created a Bash Script to execute on the targeted server to configure the installation of
            JDK, Kafka, starting of zookeeper, setting up all the path variables, starting Kafka and doing post
            deployment checks</p>
