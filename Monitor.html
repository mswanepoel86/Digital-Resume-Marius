        <strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>
        <p>This wasn’t so much a problem that needed to be solved, but I was burning to find an opportunity to use AKA
            .Net, which I thought was very powerful.
            When our request to use the licensed production monitoring tools to monitor our client dev & certification
            environments, I saw an opportunity to tackle this by using AKA .Net.
        </p>
        <strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
        <p>I created a monitoring app using AKA .Net to create an actor system that dynamically scales to the number of
            servers and environments specified in a config file. This however, presented in challenge. The resources the
            application was hosted on.</p>
        <p>To solve this issue, I made the number of actors and nodes assigned to each actor configurable. This allowed
            us to adapt the configuration according to the server spec it was running on.</p>
        <p>This application would then read the servers for each configured environment from a SQL database, spawn the
            actors to run a standard four (4) ping check on each server capturing the responses and response times. Any
            check that failed will then be reported back by calling the notification API created with the result
            alerting us via Teams and Outlook to which server and environment wasn’t operational.</p>
