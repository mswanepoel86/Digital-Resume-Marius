        <strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>
        <p>We had mobile games launching in an iframe. This however, presented us with an issue where we were unable to
            interact with any of the objects within the iframe. The objective was to be able to determine at the very
            least if the game launched successfully.</p>

        <strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
        <p>I decided to have a look at image comparison solutions. The idea was to create image templates of sections
            within the loaded game to do a pattern match within the image.
            I created a solution where I loaded up the game from within the lobby, captured a screenshot after the
            expected SLA. I then converted the image and the template I would like to match to Bitmap.
        </p>
        <p>This was followed
            by converting the images to grey scale.
            There was still one problem the image was not at the right scale to do a successful comparison. So, I
            resized the images to match in scale. Finally, I compared the image template to the image to match the
            pattern of the template within a range of 90% match.</p>
