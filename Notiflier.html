        <h1>Built a Notification Sytem for Alerting</h1>

        <strong>THE PROBLEM</strong>
        <p>During my time as an integration specialist at Derivco I had some challenges finding a way to centralize our
            notifications and alerting. The issue was not the fact that we did not have alerting in place, but rather
            the alerts were all decentralized and made maintenance and updates cumbersome and time consuming.</p>

        <strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
        <p>I then decided to tackle this problem hands on in my spare time to build an API that could handle all alerts
            regardless of its origin. I then added two modules to the notification system (Email & Teams). The purpose
            of these modules would be to send the alerts to a DL or Teams Channel based off a configuration file. </p>
